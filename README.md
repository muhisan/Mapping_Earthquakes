# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to show different earthquakes data of the last seven days on a map. The data is extracted from a USGS website that contains the geographic coordinates and magnitude of earthquakes worldwide.
Basil and Sadhana like the way we created the first two earthquake maps and they wanted us to add earthquake data relative to the location of tectonic plates on the earth, earthquakes of a magnitude greater than 4,5 on the map, and they would also like to see that data on a third dark map.
